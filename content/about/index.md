![Ricard Flores](/images/profile_pic.jpg)

I'm **Ricard Flores**, a computer engineer from Spain who's been leading high performing engineering teams for over 8 years, more recently pivoting my career more towards Cybersecurity and IT leadership. I've been responsible for product and corporate security, team hiring and management, multi-year strategy implementation, vendor management, budget management and process optimization for the majority of those years. Directly involved hands-on in technical implementation of many of the tools and technical controls, I consider myself a servant leader, leading by example. Even keeping a strategic mindset and high-level overview of the departments I've led in the past, I always find time to hop onto some of the hard tasks to help out my team to tackle. 

I'm also a Board member of the [ISMS Forum Barcelona regional chapter](https://www.ismsforum.es/) and CEH certified (Certified Ethical Hacker).
